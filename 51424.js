// You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

// Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

// If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either -1 or an empty value like None or null, depending on your language. You may assume the argument is non-negative.

// Examples:(Input --> Output)

// 121 --> 144
// 625 --> 676
// 114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square

function findNextSquare(sq){
    var root1;
    var nextroot;
    if(Math.sqrt(sq)%1 ===0){
         root1=Math.sqrt(sq)
         nextroot=root1+1
    }else{
        return -1;
    }
    return nextroot*nextroot;
}

findNextSquare(625) 

// There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

// input
// customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
// n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
// output
// The function should return an integer, the total time required.

// Important
// Please look at the examples and clarifications below, to ensure you understand the task correctly :)

// Examples
// queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
// // should return 12
// // because when there is 1 till, the total time is just the sum of the times

// queueTime([10,2,3,3], 2)
// // should return 10
// // because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the 
// // queue finish before the 1st person has finished.

// queueTime([2,3,10], 2)
// // should return 12
// Clarifications
// There is only ONE queue serving many tills, and
// The order of the queue NEVER changes, and
// The front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.
// N.B. You should assume that all the test input will be valid, as specified above.

// P.S. The situation in this kata can be likened to the more-computer-science-related idea of a thread pool, with relation to running multiple processes at the same time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool

function queueTime(customers, n) {
    var arr = new Array(n).fill(0);
  
    for (var i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
      var idx = arr.indexOf(Math.min(...arr));
      arr[idx] += customers[i];
    }
  
    return Math.max(...arr);
