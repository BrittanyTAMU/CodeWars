This repository holds my daily coding challenges from CodeWars. Each file contains the challenge instructions along with my solution. I predominantly use JavaScript to tackle these challenges, showcasing its functionality. Moreover, I apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in my JavaScript code to create modular and reusable components for the calculators.

Lessons Learned: Through tackling these challenging and sometimes peculiar problems, I've honed my skills in writing more efficient JavaScript code. My primary aim is to enhance my proficiency in JavaScript, and engaging with a new challenge every day serves as a valuable tool for achieving that goal.
