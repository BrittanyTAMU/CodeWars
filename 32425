Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

solution: 

var strStr = function(haystack, needle) {
    // P:no nums, no special chars, no floats, no cap, no funny biz
    // R: return incex of the first occ of (a,b)
    // E:  haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad" -> 0, a = "dogfiddle" b = "fiddle" ->3
    // P:
    return haystack.indexOf(needle)
    //indexOf gives us the first occurence 
    //took str a, and used indexOf to find the first occ of b inside of str a
};
