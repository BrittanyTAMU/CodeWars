Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if they were all numbers

solution:
P:
no neg nums, no floated or dec values

R:
return -> sum (string and num)
E:
return '3' + 3 = 6

P:
//convert strings to num (map)
//reduce .reduce((a,c) a + c, 0)

function sumMix(arr){
  return arr.map(Number).reduce((a,c) => a + c, 0)
}
