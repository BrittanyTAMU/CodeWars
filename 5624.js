// The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

// In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

// Examples
// highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
// highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
// highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
// Notes
// All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
// There will always be at least one number in the input string.
// Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.
